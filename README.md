   mkdir test
   ```

   ```
   
   ```

4. Switch to your branch:

   ```
   
   ```

3. Check your branch status:

   ```
   
   ```

4. Push to your remote branch:

   ```
   
   ```

5. Open a pull request from your branch to master:

   ```
   
   ```

6. Wait for a senior member to approve and merge your content into master. You can continue pushing to your branch, all commits are squished in a single pull request until it is approved.

   In case of emergency, you can bypass the standard approval procedure:

   ```
   
   ```

7. Check GitLab or whatever to make sure your changes are really there. Or don't: Live dangerously.
